# Assignment 3

## Q4 
**Plot the average loss values for training and validation. Compare the language generation performances of vanilla RNN and LSTM in terms of loss values for validation dataset.**

![Losses](../result/loss_plot.png)

Due to short-term memory and gradient vanishing problems, RNN showed low performance than LSTM. 

## Q6
**Softmax function with a temperature parameter T can be written as:**</br>
$y_i = \frac{\exp(z_i / T)}{\sum{\exp(z_i / T)}}$</br>
**Try different temperatures when you generate characters, and discuss what difference the temperature makes and why it helps to generate more plausible results.**

Temperature plays a crucial role in controlling the diversity and quality of the generated output.</br>
At **low temperature**, the model tends to generate more deterministic predictions by selecting the most probable characters for the next sequence. Consequently, the generated text tends to be more coherent and predictable.</br>
At **high temperature**, the model tends to generate more diverse and creative output. The predictions become less deterministic, resulting in a more uniform distribution of characters and allowing for a wider range of possible outcomes.</br>
**By adjusting the temperature, model can generate balanced text between coherence and creatividy.**
